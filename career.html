An interface is a set of commands or menus through which a user communicates with a program. A command-driven interface is one in which you enter commands. A menu-driven interface is one in which you select command choices from various menus displayed on the screen.
The user interface is one of the most important parts of sany program because it determines how easily you can make the program do what you want. A powerful program with a poorly designed user interface has little value. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that use windows, icons, and pop-up menus have become standard on personal computers. </p>

                        <p class="section-text"> The goal of a web user interface designer is make websites easy to learn. A brand new user that lands on your website with at least one goal in mind is going to want to navigate your site like they’ve been going there for years. This is easy to do if you use a good user interface. 
                        <br>
                        <br>

                            To make a website work, you need a few basic UI elements:
                              <ul>
                                <li> User Input Options </li>
                                <li> Navigation Options </li>
                                <li> Help Options </li>
                                </ul>

                             </p>
                             
                          <br>

                        <p class="section-text"> 
                        User input options include the elements of a site the user inputs. Anything they click and interact with is considered the user input. These elements can include buttons, drag and drops, dropdowns, and other interactive elements. These options are specifically meant to guide your user to the next relevant area of your website. Assuming your user input was appropriately labeled, they should get to the place they wanted, but maybe they changed their mind or went to the wrong place. If this is the case, they want to get back to where they were, or maybe they want to go somewhere else entirely. Now your navigation options come into play.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="section-text"> 
                        Navigation options are any elements that can guide your user from where they are to anywhere they may want to go. Many times, sites use search bars as their primary navigation options; however, breadcrumb navigation and sidebars can also be useful in guiding your users. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="section-text"> 
                        Last but not least, the user may be completely lost and just doesn’t understand something. In this case, one must have help options such as little messages along the way that let them know what they’re looking at/doing, or just a little help button that can help them out with whatever it is your site is designed to do.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-text"> Google’s Play Store has thousands of apps and free/paid downloadable software that is used across numerous devices. Organizing a large quantity of apps like this should be a difficult challenge, but Google made it so easy to use that there’s no problem finding anything you need in just 1-2 clicks. Their design is simple, easy-to-use, and plain attractive. The screen is so clean, partially due to the navigation menu in the top left-hand corner. The nav bar doesn’t go across the top, instead they made use of a lack of sidebars and used that space to cleanly organize their categories. </p>
