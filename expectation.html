                        <p class="section-text"> Being an UI Designer is much better now than it was a decade ago. A few years ago, in tech companies, having a designer as a core founding member was not common -- not many took design seriously. However, lately people have realized that the way that a product feels and how it reacts to users' inputs is key. Since then, companies such as Airbnb (which was founded by two designers) and Apple, have pioneered the importance of the designer. Design is at the core of these companies and it has everyone clamoring for talent. 
                        
                        <br><br> Right now, there is <span class="bold green">6,652 job postings</span> on Indeed, one of the world's biggest job posting sites. There are <span class="bold green">215,562 employment options</span> in the country and <span class="bold green">150,898 businesses hiring.</span>
                        
                        
                        <br><br> Designers are given the chance to work on major projects within companies, such as Facebook's Timeline by our previously mentioned hero, Nicholas Felton. 
                        
                        Jobs are secure as well, as there is an increased focus on designers in companies. 
                        
                        There is space to advance, from junior to senior levels and different sectors of design.
                        
                        Hours, for the most part, are fine. If you wish to push yourself beyond what the employer demands, there is space for it.
                        
                        Working conditions are safe, not injurious to health, not stressful, and comfortable.

                        <p class="section-text"> Designers will continue to grow in popularity. Due to this, they will continue to work on major projects, cherish job security, have the potential to be promoted, work the minimum or many more hours, and enjoy comfortable work environments.
                        
                           Moreover, it is becoming more practical to start a company with a designer as a core member. In the next few years, this trend will continue. Companies are setting examples and people are sure to follow.
                        
                        <br><br> Design will be at the core of every successful company soon and because of that, the <span class="bold green"> expected growth in the next five years is 4.9%.</span> 
                        
                        <br><br>The <span class="bold green">revenue is expected to climb to $24 billion</span> for the industry. <span class="bold green">There is a projected 6,652 job postings </span> on Indeed in the next few years.
